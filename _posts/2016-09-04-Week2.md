1. What did you do this past week?
	* This week we talked about Collatz, which is a rather fascinating math conjecture. It says that we are given a positive integer n  and we can perform two operations. 
	  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  a. If the integer is even then we divide n by 2 until we get a quotient of 1.
	* b. If n is odd, then we must do 3 *n + 1. If the new number is even, then we go back to a. Else, we keep repeating b until we get an even number.
	* What’s interesting about this problem is that no matter what number we get, we will always end up getting 1 as our final number. 
* Another thing I did this week was install Docker.
	2	What's in your way?
	* I couldn’t remember some things about Python. For instance, I have forgotten how to use decorators and generators. So I have to review that and practice. 
	3	What will you do next week?
